## Usage

Add a dimension for the x-axis.
Add a measure for each data series to be displayed.
Define the configuration, display and behaviour of the chart using the Graph Options properties.  Graph Options are divided into two sections: Labels and Display.

### Notes
* Valid data types for the x-axis (dimension) are numeric (default) and date.
* To display error bars for a series, three measures are required and should be arranged by value in ascending order (i.e. low, middle, high).  Multiple series may be displayed with error bars if sets of three measures are selected and arranged in the same fashion.
* The Error Bars and Fill Graph properties are not compatible.
